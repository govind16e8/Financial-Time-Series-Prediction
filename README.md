# Financial Time Series Prediction with LSTMs

This project demonstrates how to use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks for predicting financial time series data, such as stock prices. The model is trained on historical data to forecast future trends accurately.

### Features
- Data preprocessing and normalization.
- Time series modeling using LSTM.
- Evaluation with RMSE and visual comparison of predictions.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`

### Usage
1. Place your financial dataset `your_data.csv` in the project directory.
2. Update the file path in `main.py`.
3. Run the script to train the model and visualize predictions.

### Output
The script generates plots comparing actual and predicted values for training and testing datasets.
